# Style + Linting

Unlike iOS, Backend doesn't have an editor that's obviously superior to others. Popular choices by previous members include: Atom, VSCode, vim, emacs. 

However, it's important that your editor of choice includes linting. 

### What is linting?

When your editor _lints_ your code, it outputs errors and warnings regarding code that is stylistically incorrect. Generally, this relates to syntactic errors but can include warnings/errors related to the code itself: for example, a linter might output warnings that a variable was defined but never used.

This allows us to automate this step while writing code, and helping us find stylistic/logical errors resulting from typos and other mistakes much more easily!
