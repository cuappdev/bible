# Git Issues

This year we'd like to standardize our git issues so it's easier for members to see what each pod is working on.

## Issues

### Title

The title of an issue should have:

* **Proper capitalization** - so as to the standardize the style of our issues and be more readable for the open-source community
* **Start with a verb** - so to better describe what someone should do

Example: Proper capitalization

| No | Yes |
| :--- | :--- |
| delete extraneous branches | Delete extraneous branches |
| fix bug in Route class | Fix bug in Route class |

Example: Start with a verb

| No | Yes |
| :--- | :--- |
| Search bar bug | Fix search bar bug |
| Fabric setup | Setup Fabric |
| Font size should be smaller | Make font size smaller |
| Updating to latest Swift | Update to latest Swift |

## Labels

We'll use 2 types of labels to describe the issue:

* **Priority** - how urgent is the issue to the pod
* **Type** - what kind of problem does this issue address

| Label | Description | Hex Color |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Priority: Critical | For issues that break the master branch |  |
| Priority: High | For issues that the pod wants to work on first  |  |
| Priority: Medium | For issues that the pod wants to work on but are not high priority |  |
| Priority: Low | For issues that the pod may want to work on later in the future |  |
| Priority: Never | For issues that the pod will not work on  |  |

| Label | Description | Hex Color |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Type: Bug | For issues that address bugs in the app |  |
| Type: Design | For issues that change or add to the visuals of the app |  |
| Type: Feature | For issues that add a new feature to the app |  |
| Type: Enhancement | For issues that will add to the app, but are not necessarily stand -alone features |  |
| Type: Maintenance | For issues that help keep the app stable |  |

We'll also have miscellaneous labels can be used to describe additional aspects of an issue:

| Label | Description | Hex Color |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Note: Question | For issues that need further information or discussion |  |
| Note: Help Wanted | For issues that need more eyes |  |
| Note: Good First Issue | For issues that will help new members onboard |  |
| Note: Duplicate | For issues that already exists |  |
