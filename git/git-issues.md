# Git Issues

This year we'd like to standardize our git issues so it's easier for members to see what each pod is working on.

## Issues

## Labels

We'll use 3 types of labels to describe the issue:

* **Priority** - how urgent is the issue to the pod
* **Status** - what progress has been made on the issue
* **Type** - what kind of problem does this issue address

| Label | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Priority: Critical | For issues that break the master branch |
| Priority: High | For issues that the pod wants to work on first  |
| Priority: Medium | For issues that the pod wants to work on but are not high priority |
| Priority: Low | For issues that the pod may want to work on later in the future |
| Priority: Never | For issues that the pod will not work on  |

| Label | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Status: Available | For issues that have not been assigned to anyone |
| Status: Assigned | For issues that have been assigned |
| Status: In Progress | For issues that have been started on and being currently worked on |
| Status: Blocked | For issues where the assignee is blocked on working on the issue \(e.g. further information or help is needed\) |
| Status: In PR | For issues where a PR has been submitted |
| Status: Completed | For issues whose changes have been merged into master |

| Label | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Type: Bug | For issues that address bugs in the app |
| Type: Design | For issues that change or add to the visuals of the app |
| Type: Feature | For issues that add a new feature to the app |
| Type: Enhancement | For issues that will add to the app, but are not necessarily stand -alone features |
| Type: Maintenance | For issues that help keep the app stable |

We'll also have miscellaneous labels can be used to describe additional aspects of an issue:

| Label | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Question | For issues that need further information or discussion |
| Help Wanted | For issues that need more eyes |
| Good First Issue | For issues that will help new members onboard |
| Duplicate | For issues that already exists |
