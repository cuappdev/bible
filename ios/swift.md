# Swift

At AppDev we use Swift heavily for iOS development \(and potentially server-side development in the future\).

## Linting

We want to enforce similar Swift style and standard practices, so we are beginning to use [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint). Our config file [`.swiftlint.yml`](https://github.com/cuappdev/bible/tree/a61eb48cd8c7afcb7b31e93eab2acf619349ee46/swift/.swiftlint.yml) is present in this directory.
