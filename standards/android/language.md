# Language

Our apps are built with either Java or Kotlin. As of Fall 2019, Eatery is built with Java; and Pollo and Transit is built with Kotlin. 

### Java

Apps built with Java are intended to be "onboarding" projects for newer members to ease into Android Development as most developers are familiar with Java. 

### Kotlin

Because the industry is moving towards Kotlin as the main Android development language, developers are encourage to build apps with Kotlin. Kotlin is syntactically similar to XCode, thus writing Kotlin apps makes transitions between iOS and Android development much easier.
