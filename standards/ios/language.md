# Language

## Swift

We use Swift as our programming language of choice for iOS development.

### Linting

We want to enforce similar Swift style and standard practices, so we are beginning to use [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint). Our config file [`.swiftlint.yml`](https://github.com/cuappdev/bible/tree/a61eb48cd8c7afcb7b31e93eab2acf619349ee46/swift/.swiftlint.yml) is present in this directory.

## Objective-C

Very little of our code is written in Objective-C.

## Cross-Platform

We've been investigating React Native for a while now, but it currently does not serve our needs as well as native development does.
