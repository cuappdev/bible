# Swift

At AppDev we use Swift heavily for iOS development \(and potentially server-side development in the future.

We want to enforce similar Swift style and standard practices, so we are beginning to use [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint).

## Configuration

Our config file [`.swiftlint.yml`](/swift/.swiftlint.yml) is present in this directory.
